## Abstract

Fast applications can be the key to a lot of benefits for both individuals and organisations. With a recent move into a more cloud-focused technology world, more time processing data can cost more, and so being able to process the same amount of data in less time can be beneficial. This study reviews the performances of implementations of C#, Java, and Python at handling many collections (e.g. Stacks and Queues) and their primary methods and operations. The tests were run with differing levels of processing required with collections containing from 1 to 10000 (1, 10, 1000, 10000) items of primitive or object type. The results found that C#â€™s .NET Core was the best performing out of all the implementations tested between the three languages. Despite this, recommendations were made at the end of the study that advised considering other factors depending on each individual scenario before making a decision based on the outcome of the testing.
